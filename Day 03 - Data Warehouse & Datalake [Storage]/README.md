# Day 3: Power BI Dashboard Creation

## Overview
Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with a simple interface for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.

## Key Concepts

- **Dashboards**: A Power BI dashboard is a single-page, often called a canvas, that uses visualizations to tell a story. A dashboard combines data from multiple sources, providing a comprehensive view of key metrics.

- **Reports**: A Power BI report is a multi-perspective view into a dataset, with visualizations that represent different findings and insights. Reports can contain multiple pages and visualizations.

- **Datasets**: A dataset in Power BI is a collection of data that you import or connect to. It is the basis for your dashboards and reports.

## Dashboard Creation Process

1. **Data Import**:
   - Imported data from various sources such as Excel, SQL Server, and online services.
   - Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query Editor to ensure it was ready for analysis.

2. **Data Modeling**:
   - Established relationships between different tables to create a coherent data model.
   - Created calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to enhance the dataset.

3. **Creating Visualizations**:
   - Selected appropriate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, pie charts, tables) to represent data effectively.
   - Customized visualizations by adjusting properties like colors, labels, and formatting.

4. **Building the Dashboard**:
   - Combined various visualizations onto a single canvas to create an interactive dashboard.
   - Used slicers and filters to allow users to interact with the data and explore different views.

5. **Publishing and Sharing**:
   - Published the dashboard to the Power BI service.
   - Shared the dashboard with stakeholders for real-time access to insights and data-driven decision-making.

## Learnings

- **Data Import & Transformation**: Learned how to import data from multiple sources and clean it using Power Query Editor.
- **Data Modeling**: Understood the importance of relationships and DAX in creating a robust data model.
- **Visualizations**: Gained experience in selecting and customizing visualizations to best represent the data.
- **Interactivity**: Implemented slicers and filters to enhance user interaction with the dashboard.
- **Collaboration**: Published the dashboard and shared it with team members, enabling collaborative data analysis.

## Conclusion
Creating a Power BI dashboard provided a practical understanding of how to transform raw data into meaningful insights through visualizations. The ability to interact with data in real-time and share insights with stakeholders is a powerful feature of Power BI.
