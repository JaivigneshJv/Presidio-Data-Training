# Day 8: Git Integration, CI/CD Pipelines, and Exploration of Jenkins

## Overview

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are crucial practices in modern software development. CI/CD pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications, ensuring that code changes are consistently integrated, tested, and released with minimal manual intervention.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. CI/CD Pipelines
A **CI/CD pipeline** is a series of automated processes that enable DevOps teams to streamline and automate the software delivery process. It involves several stages:

- **Source Code Management (SCM):** Typically integrated with version control systems like Git, where the source code is stored and managed.
- **Build:** The process of compiling the code, resolving dependencies, and creating artifacts that can be deployed.
- **Test:** Automated tests are run to ensure the integrity of the code, including unit tests, integration tests, and more.
- **Deploy:** The final stage where the code is deployed to different environments (e.g., staging, production).

#### 2. Webhooks
**Webhooks** are automated messages sent from apps when something happens. They are a way for one system to notify another system of an event or change, often triggering a CI/CD pipeline. For example:

- When code is pushed to a Git repository, a webhook can trigger a CI build process.
- Webhooks can be configured in Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitLab, etc., to integrate with external systems like Jenkins, Slack, or custom applications.

#### 3. Jenkins
**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server that helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.

- **Plugins:** Jenkins is highly extensible with a rich ecosystem of plugins that support various tools, services, and workflows.
- **Declarative Pipelines:** Jenkins uses a domain-specific language (DSL) written in Groovy to define CI/CD pipelines. Pipelines can be declarative or scripted, providing flexibility in how CI/CD processes are configured.
- **Integration:** Jenkins integrates with various source control systems, including Git, and can trigger builds based on webhooks, schedules, or manual triggers.

## CI/CD Pipeline in Azure DevOps

In Azure DevOps, you can create a CI/CD pipeline by setting up a build pipeline and a release pipeline. Hereâ€™s a general overview of how it works:

1. **Build Pipeline:**
   - The build pipeline automates the process of compiling and testing your code.
   - It integrates with source control repositories like Git, where it can be triggered by code pushes, pull requests, or other events.
   - The build artifacts are stored and can be used later in the release pipeline.

2. **Release Pipeline:**
   - The release pipeline deploys your build artifacts to various environments like development, staging, and production.
   - It can be triggered automatically after a successful build or manually.



## Exploring Jenkins

### Setting Up Jenkins
- **Installation:** Jenkins can be installed on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can also be run inside a Docker container.
- **Job Configuration:** In Jenkins, a "job" or "project" is a task or a group of tasks that Jenkins runs. You can configure jobs for building projects, running tests, or deploying applications.
- **Pipeline as Code:** Jenkins allows you to define your pipeline using a `Jenkinsfile`. This file is stored in the root of your repository and defines the steps to be executed.

### Sample Jenkins Pipeline (Declarative)
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                sh 'yarn install'
                sh 'yarn build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                sh 'yarn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                // Add deployment steps here
            }
        }
    }
}
```
